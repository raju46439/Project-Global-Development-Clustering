**Global Development Clustering — Project Overview**

**Objective**: Cluster countries based on socio-economic indicators to uncover development patterns using unsupervised learning.

**Clustering Methods**: Implements KMeans, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical (Agglomerative) clustering.

**Evaluation**: Uses silhouette scores to compare clustering performance across methods.

**Visualization**: PCA-based 2D scatterplots with legends to show cluster separation.

**Cluster Profiling**: Describes each cluster using adaptive, percentile-based summaries (e.g., Low/Moderate/High GDP).

**Interactive App**: Streamlit interface for model selection, parameter tuning, and real-time visualization.

**Notebook Analysi**s: Jupyter notebook includes reproducible code for comparative analysis and profiling.

**Data Handling**: Cleans missing values, scales features, and excludes noise points from summaries.

**Use Case**: Ideal for policy analysis, development research, and exploratory data science.

**Tech Stack**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Streamlit
